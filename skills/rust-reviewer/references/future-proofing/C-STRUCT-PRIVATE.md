# C-STRUCT-PRIVATE

Making a field public is a strong commitment: it pins down a representation choice, and prevents the type from providing any validation or maintaining any invariants on the contents of the field, since clients can mutate it arbitrarily.

Public fields are most appropriate for `struct` types in the C spirit: compound, passive data structures. Otherwise, consider providing getter/setter methods and hiding fields instead.
