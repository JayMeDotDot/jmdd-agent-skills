# C-EVOCATIVE

A good guide is to use syntax, especially keywords and punctuation, that is similar to what will be produced in the output of the macro.

For example if your macro declares a struct with a particular name given in the input, preface the name with the keyword `struct` to signal to readers that a struct is being declared with the given name.
```rust
// Prefer this...
bitflags! {
    struct S: u32 { /* ... */ }
}

// ...over no keyword...
bitflags! {
    S: u32 { /* ... */ }
}

// ...or some ad-hoc word.
bitflags! {
    flags S: u32 { /* ... */ }
}
```

Another example is semicolons vs commas. Constants in Rust are followed by semicolons so if your macro declares a chain of constants, they should likely be followed by semicolons even if the syntax is otherwise slightly different from Rust's.
```rust
fn main() {
// Ordinary constants use semicolons.
const A: u32 = 0b000001;
const B: u32 = 0b000010;

// So prefer this...
bitflags! {
    struct S: u32 {
        const C = 0b000100;
        const D = 0b001000;
    }
}

// ...over this.
bitflags! {
    struct S: u32 {
        const E = 0b010000,
        const F = 0b100000,
    }
}
```
