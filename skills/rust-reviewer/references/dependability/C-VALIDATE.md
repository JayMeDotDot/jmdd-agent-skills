# C-VALIDATE

Rust APIs do not generally follow the robustness principle: "be conservative in what you send; be liberal in what you accept".

Instead, Rust code should enforce the validity of input whenever practical.

Enforcement can be achieved through the following mechanisms (listed in order of preference).

## Static enforcement

Choose an argument type rules out bad inputs.

For example, prefer:

```rust
fn foo(a: Ascii) {/* ... */}
```

Over:

```rust
fn foo(a: u8) {/* ... */}
```

where `Ascii` is a wrapper around `u8` that guarrantees the highest bit is zero; see newtype patterns([C-NEWTYPE](skills/rust-reviewer/references/type-safty/C-NEWTYPE.md)) for more details on creating typesafe wrappers.

Static enforcement usually comes at little run-time cost: it pushes the costs to the boundaries(e.g. when a `u8` is first converted into an `Ascii`). It also catches bugs early, during compilation, rather than through run-time failures.

On the other hand, some properties are difficult or impossible to express using types.

## Dynamic enforcement

Validate the input as it is processed (or ahead of time, if necessary). Dynamic checking is often easier to implement than static checking, but has several downsides:

1. Runtime overhead (unless checking can be done as part of processing the input).
2. Delayed detection of bugs.
3. Introduces failure cases, either via `panic!` or `Result`/`Option` types, which must then be dealt with by client code.

### Dynamic enforcement with `debug_assert!`

Same as dynamic enforcement, but with the possibility of easily turning off expensive checks for production builds.

### Dynamic enforcement with opt-out

Same as dynamic enforcement, but adds sibling functions that opt out of the checking.

The convention is to mark these pot-out functions with a suffix like `_unchecked` or by placing them in a `raw` submodule.

The unchecked functions can be used judiciously in cases where (1) performance dictates avoiding checks and (2) the client is otherwise confident that the inputs are valid.
