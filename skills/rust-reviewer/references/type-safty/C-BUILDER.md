# C-BUILDER

Some data structures are complicated to construct, due to their construction needing:

- a large number of inputs
- compound data (e.g. slices)
- optional configuration data
- choice between several flavors

which can easily lead to a large number of distinct constructors with many arguments each.

If `T` is such a data structure, consider introducing a `T` builder:

1. Introduce a separate data type `TBuilder` for incrementally configuring a `T` value. When possible, choose a better name: e.g. `Command` is the builder for a child process, `Url` can be created from a `ParseOptions`.
2. The builder constructor should take as parameters only the data required to make a `T`.
3. The builder should offer a suite of convenient methods for configuration, including setting up compound inputs (like slices) incrementally. These methods should return `self`  to allow chaining.
4. The builder should provide one or more "terminal" methods for actually building a `T`.

The builder pattern is especially appropriate when building a `T` involves side effects, such as spawning a task or launching a process.

In rust, there are two variants of the builder pattern, differing in the treatment of ownership, as described below.

## Non-consuming builders (preferred)

In some cases, constructing the final `T` does not require the builder itself to be consumed. The following variant on `std::process::Command` is one example:

```rust
// NOTE: the actual Command API does not use owned Strings;
// this is a simplified version.
pub struct Command {
    program: String,
    args: Vec<String>,
    cwd: Option<String>,
    // etc
}

impl Command {
    pub fn new(program: String) -> Command {
        Command {
            program,
            args: Vec::new(),
            cwd: None,
        }
    }

    // Add an argument to pass to the program.
    pub fn arg(&mut self, arg: String) -> &mut Command {
        self.args.push(arg);
        self
    }
    
    // Add multiple arguments to pass to the program
    pub fn args(&mut self, args: &[String]) -> &mut Command {
        self.args.extend_from_slice(args);
        self
    }
    
    // Set the working directory for the child process
    pub fn cwd(&mut self, cwd: String) -> &mut Command {
        self.cwd = Some(cwd);
        self
    }
    
    // Execute the command as a child process, which is returned.
    pub fn spawn(&self) -> std::io::Result<std::process::Child> {
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

Note that the `spawn` method, which actually uses the builder configuration to spawn a process, takes the builder by shared reference. This is possible because spawning the process does not require ownership of the configuration data.

Because the terminal `spawn` method only needs a reference, the configuration methods take and return a mutable borrow of `self`.

### The benefit

By using borrows throughout, `Command` can be used conveniently for both one-liner and more complex constructions:

```rust
// One-liners
Command::new("/bin/cat").arg("file.txt").spawn();

// Complex configuration
let mut cmd = Command::new("/bin/ls");
if size_sorted {
    cmd.arg("-S");
}
cmd.arg(".");
cmd.spawn();
```

## Consuming builders

Sometimes builders must transfer ownership when constructing the final type `T`, meaning that the terminal methods must take `self` rather than `&self`.

```rust
impl TaskBuilder {
    /// Name the task-to-be.
    pub fn named(mut self, name: String) -> TaskBuilder {
        self.name = Some(name);
        self
    }

    /// Redirect task-local stdout.
    pub fn stdout(mut self, stdout: Box<io::Write + Send>) -> TaskBuilder {
        self.stdout = Some(stdout);
        self
    }

    /// Creates and executes a new child task.
    pub fn spawn<F>(self, f: F) where F: FnOnce() + Send {
        /* ... */
    }
}
```

Here, the `stdout` configuration involves passing ownership of an `io::Write`, which must be transferred to the task upon construction (in `spawn`).

When the terminal methods of the builder require ownership, there is a basic tradeoff:

- If the other builder methods take/return a mutable borrow, the complex configuration case will work well, but one-liner configuration becomes impossible.
- If the other builder methods take/return an owned `self`, one-liners continue to work well but complex configuration is less convenient.

Under the rubric of making easy things easy and hard things possible, all builder methods for a consuming builder should take and return an owned `self`. Then client code works as follows:

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
// One-liners
TaskBuilder::new("my_task").spawn(|| { /* ... */ });

// Complex configuration
let mut task = TaskBuilder::new();
task = task.named("my_task_2"); // must re-assign to retain ownership
if reroute {
    task = task.stdout(mywriter);
}
task.spawn(|| { /* ... */ });
}
```

One-liners work as before, beacuse ownership is threaded through each of the builder methods until beging consumed by `spawn`. Complex configuration, however, is more verbose, it requires re-assigning the builder at each step.
