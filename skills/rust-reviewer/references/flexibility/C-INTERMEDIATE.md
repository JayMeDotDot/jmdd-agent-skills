# C-INTERMEDIATE

Many functions that answer a question also compute interesting related data. If this data is potentially of interest to the client, consider exposing it in the API.

## Examples from the standard library
- `Vec::binary_search` does not return a `bool` of whether the value was found, nor an `Option<usize>` of the index at which the value was maybe found. Instead it returns information about the index if found, and also the index at which the value need to be inserted if not found.
- `String::from_utf8` may fail if the input bytes are not UTF-8. In the error case it returns an intermediate result that exposes the byte offset up to which the input was valid UTF-8, as well as handing back ownership of the input bytes.
- `HashMap::insert` returns an `Option<T>` that returns the preexisting value for a given key, if any. For cases where the user wants to recover this value having it returned by the insert operation avoids the user having to do a second hash table lookup.
