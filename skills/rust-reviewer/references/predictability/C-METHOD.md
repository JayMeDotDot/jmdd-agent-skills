# C-METHOD

Prefer 

```rust
impl Foo {
    pub fn frob(&self, w: widget) { /* ... */}
}
```

over 

```rust
pub fn frob(foo: &Foo, w: widget) { /* ... */}
```

for any operation that is clearly associated with a particular type.

Methods have numerous advantages over functions:
- They do not need to be imported or qualified to be used: all you need is a value of the appropriate type.
- Their invocation performs autoborrowing(including mutable borrows).
- They make it easy to answer the question "what can I do with a value of type `T`"(especially when using rustdoc).
- They provide `self` notation, which is more concise and often more clearly conveys ownership distinctions.
