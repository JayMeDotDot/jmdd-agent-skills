# C-OVERLOAD

Operators with built in syntax (`*`, `|`, and so on) can be provided for a type by implementing the traits in `std::ops`. These operators come with strong expectations: implement `Mul` only for an operation that bears some resemblance to multiplication (and shares the expected properties, e.g. associativity), and so on for the other traits.
